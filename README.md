# Tariff Rate Tracker

Daily statutory U.S. tariff rates at the HTS-10 × country level, built from USITC Harmonized Tariff Schedule JSON archives. Produced by [The Budget Lab at Yale](https://budgetlab.yale.edu/).

The tracker processes 39 HTS revisions (January 2025 through February 2026) to construct a panel of ~4.5 million product-country tariff rates per revision. This process uses HTS data sources, combined with ancillary data and economic assumptions detailed below, to estimate tariff rates. Outputs are designed for use with The Budget Lab at Yale [Tariff-Model](https://github.com/Budget-Lab-Yale/Tariff-Model).

## The U.S. Tariff Regime (2025–2026)

### Tariff Authorities

| Authority | Legal Basis | Scope | Rate Range |
|-----------|-------------|-------|------------|
| **Section 232** | Trade Expansion Act §232 | Steel, aluminum, autos, copper, derivatives | 25–50% (50% for steel/aluminum/copper post-June 2025; 25% for autos, UK deals) |
| **Section 301** | Trade Act §301 | China (Lists 1–4B, Biden acceleration, cranes) | 7.5–100% |
| **IEEPA Reciprocal** | International Emergency Economic Powers Act | ~60 countries (Phases 1 & 2) | 10–50% (surcharge or floor) |
| **IEEPA Fentanyl** | International Emergency Economic Powers Act | Canada, Mexico | 25–35% |
| **Section 122** | Trade Act §122 | All countries (150-day statutory limit) | 10–25% |

### Pre-2025 Baseline

The tariff regime inherited at the start of 2025 included:

- **MFN base rates**: ~2% import-weighted average (after FTA/GSP preference adjustment; ~4% statutory)
- **Section 232 steel/aluminum** (2018/2020): 25% on chapters 72–73 (steel) and 76 (aluminum)
- **Section 301 China** (2018–2024): 7.5–25% across Lists 1–4A, plus Biden-era accelerations on minerals, semiconductors, solar, EVs, and batteries (25–100%)

### Timeline: 2025 Through Early 2026

**January 2025.** [Executive Order 14195](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/02/07/2025-02408/imposing-duties-to-address-the-synthetic-opioid-supply-chain-in-the-peoples-republic-of-china) imposes IEEPA fentanyl surcharges on China and Hong Kong (+10%).

**February 2025.** [EO 14193](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/02/07/2025-02406/imposing-duties-to-address-the-flow-of-illicit-drugs-across-our-northern-border)/[14194](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/02/07/2025-02407/imposing-duties-to-address-the-situation-at-our-southern-border) extend fentanyl surcharges to Canada (+25%) and Mexico (+25%). China's fentanyl surcharge increases to +20% cumulative.

**March 2025.** [Proclamation 10908](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/04/03/2025-05930/adjusting-imports-of-automobiles-and-automobile-parts-into-the-united-states) imposes Section 232 tariffs on automobiles (25%, effective April 3). [Proclamation 10896](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/02/18/2025-02833/adjusting-imports-of-steel-into-the-united-states) revokes all pre-2025 Section 232 country exemptions (TRQ agreements expire March 12). Section 232 derivative products (aluminum-containing articles outside chapter 76) are added at 25%.

**April 2, 2025 — "Liberation Day."** [EO 14257](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/04/07/2025-06063/regulating-imports-with-a-reciprocal-tariff-to-rectify-trade-practices-that-contribute-to-large-and) announces IEEPA Phase 1 reciprocal tariffs: a universal 10% baseline on all countries plus country-specific surcharges on ~60 countries (11–50%). China receives +34%.

**April 3–5, 2025 — China escalation.** China's reciprocal rate escalates rapidly: +34% → +84% → +125%. All non-China Phase 1 country-specific rates are suspended for a 90-day pause. The universal 10% baseline remains active.

**April 14, 2025 — [Geneva Agreement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/05/joint-statement-on-u-s-china-economic-and-trade-meeting-in-geneva/).** US-China bilateral agreement de-escalates: China's reciprocal rate returns to +34%, then is suspended. China falls back to the universal 10% baseline.

**May 2025.** Section 232 rates on steel and aluminum derivatives [doubled from 25% to 50%](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/06/09/2025-10524/adjusting-imports-of-aluminum-and-steel-into-the-united-states). Auto parts added to 232 coverage.

**July 2025.** Canada fentanyl surcharge increased from 25% to 35%. Copper added to Section 232 coverage (headings 7406–7419).

**August 7, 2025 — IEEPA Phase 2.** [EO 14323](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/08/06/2025-15010/further-modifying-the-reciprocal-tariff-rates) reinstates country-specific reciprocal tariffs with individually negotiated rates. Phase 1 entries are unsuspended; Phase 2 rates stack on top. Key rates: Brazil +10%, UK +10%, EU 15% floor, India +25%, Switzerland +39%. Brazil also receives a [country-specific EO surcharge](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/08/05/2025-14896/addressing-threats-to-the-united-states-by-the-government-of-brazil) (+40%). India later receives its own EO (+25%, August 20), bringing its total to +50%.

**September–November 2025.** Floor rate structures negotiated with Japan (September 12), South Korea (November 15): 15% minimum rate, with passthrough for products whose base rate already exceeds 15%. Section 301 crane tariffs added (100%). China fentanyl rate reduced to +10% (post-Geneva). Semiconductor tariffs introduced (25%, January 2026).

**January 1, 2026.** [Swiss framework](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/12/18/2025-23316/implementing-certain-tariff-related-elements-of-the-framework-for-a-united-states-switzerland-liechtenstein) (EO 14346): Switzerland and Liechtenstein receive floor rate structure (15% minimum). Biden-era Section 301 acceleration: minerals, semiconductors, EVs, batteries.

### SCOTUS and Section 122

**February 20, 2026 — [*Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump*](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/25pdf/24-1287_4gcj.pdf), 607 U.S. ___ (2026).** In a 6–3 decision, the Supreme Court rules that IEEPA does not authorize tariffs (Roberts, writing for the majority). All IEEPA reciprocal and fentanyl tariffs are vacated.

The administration immediately [reimplements tariffs under Section 122](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2026/02/imposing-a-temporary-import-surcharge-to-address-fundamental-international-payments-problems/) of the Trade Act of 1974, which authorizes blanket surcharges for up to 150 days without Congressional approval. A 10% blanket tariff on all countries takes effect February 25, 2026 (HTS 9903.03.xx), with exemptions for products already subject to Section 232, IEEPA-exempt products, civil aircraft, CA/MX, CAFTA-DR, donations, and informational materials.

**The 150-day clock:** Section 122 authority expires approximately July 25, 2026. The tracker enforces this statutory limit at three levels: (1) revisions after the expiry date get `rate_s122 = 0`, (2) daily aggregates split at the expiry boundary, and (3) `get_rates_at_date()` zeroes Section 122 for post-expiry queries. A `finalized` flag in `config/policy_params.yaml` controls this behavior — set to `true` if Congress extends the authority.

Section 232 and Section 301 tariffs are unaffected by the SCOTUS ruling (separate statutory authority).

## Approach

### Pipeline Overview

For each of the 39 HTS revisions, the pipeline:

1. **Parses Chapter 99 entries** — extracts additional duty rates, authority type, and country scope
2. **Parses product lines** — extracts base MFN rates and Chapter 99 footnote references
3. **Extracts policy parameters** — IEEPA reciprocal/fentanyl rates, Section 232 rates, USMCA eligibility
4. **Calculates total rates** per HTS-10 × country using stacking rules
5. **Validates** against TPC benchmark (where a matching TPC date exists)

The orchestrator repeats these steps for each revision, producing per-revision snapshots and tracking deltas. After building, it combines snapshots into a long-format time series with temporal intervals and runs downstream scripts (daily series, weighted ETR, quality report).

### How Tariffs Link to Products

The 2025–2026 tariff measures are encoded as Chapter 99 provisions in the HTS. They link to product lines through four distinct mechanisms:

1. **Footnote references** (Section 301, IEEPA fentanyl): Product lines contain footnotes like "See 9903.88.15" that point to Ch99 subheadings specifying the duty rate and country scope.

2. **Chapter-based coverage** (Section 232): Ch99 entries reference HTS notes rather than individual product lines. Products are identified by chapter — Ch. 72–73 for steel, Ch. 76 for aluminum — or by heading prefix (8703 for autos, 7406–7419 for copper).

3. **Universal application** (IEEPA reciprocal/fentanyl): Entries in 9903.01–02.xx apply to *all* products from a given country. Each entry names the countries in its description and encodes the rate in the `general` field.

4. **Blanket non-discriminatory tariff** (Section 122): A uniform tariff on all products and all countries, with product exemptions from an Annex II list. Gated by a 150-day statutory expiry window.

A simple diff of base rates across HTS revisions would miss all four mechanisms.

### Stacking Rules Overview

Tariff authorities overlap. Section 232 and IEEPA reciprocal are **mutually exclusive** — 232 takes precedence. For derivative 232 products (metal content < 100%), IEEPA applies to the non-metal portion of customs value. See [Stacking Formulas](#stacking-formulas) for full detail.

### MFN Exemption Shares

Statutory MFN rates overstate actual base-rate collections because many imports enter under preferential trade agreements (FTAs) or programs like GSP. The tracker adjusts base rates using HS2 × country exemption shares derived from Census calculated duty data:

```
effective_base_rate = statutory_mfn_rate × (1 - exemption_share)
```

This reduces the import-weighted average base rate from ~4% (statutory) to ~2% (effective). Canada and Mexico are excluded from this adjustment — their preferences are handled at HTS-10 granularity via USMCA utilization shares. Both effective and statutory base rates are preserved in the output. Configurable via `mfn_exemption` in `config/policy_params.yaml`.

## Code Guide

### Orchestrator

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `00_build_timeseries.R` | Main entry point. Iterates over all HTS revisions, builds per-revision rate snapshots, computes deltas, runs TPC validation, and combines into a long-format time series. Supports `--full` (clean rebuild), `--start-from` (incremental), `--build-only` (skip downstream), `--core-only` (skip weighted outputs), and auto-update (default). |

### Build Pipeline (sourced by `00_build`)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|

| `02_download_hts.R` | Downloads missing HTS JSON archives from USITC; standalone with `--dry-run` |
| `03_parse_chapter99.R` | Parses Chapter 99 entries: rates from `general` field, authority type from subheading range, country scope from `description` |
| `04_parse_products.R` | Parses HTS-10 product lines: base MFN rates and Chapter 99 footnote references |
| `05_parse_policy_params.R` | Extracts policy parameters from HTS JSON: IEEPA rates (with rate_type classification), fentanyl rates, Section 232 rates (including autos), USMCA eligibility |
| `06_calculate_rates.R` | Joins products to authorities. Applies IEEPA/fentanyl as blanket country-level tariffs. Identifies 232 products by chapter/heading prefix. Gates Section 122 on statutory expiry. Adjusts base rates for FTA/GSP preferences. Applies stacking rules. Expands to country dimension. |
| `07_validate_tpc.R` | Compares calculated rates against TPC benchmark at HTS-10 × country × date level |

## Usage

### First-Time Setup

The detailed first-run guide now lives in [docs/build.md](docs/build.md). The short version is:

```bash
# 1. Check environment (packages, config, resources, data)
Rscript src/preflight.R

# 2. Install missing R packages
Rscript src/install_dependencies.R        # Required only
Rscript src/install_dependencies.R --all   # Required + optional

# 3. (Optional) Configure external file paths for weighted outputs
#    Copy config/local_paths.yaml.example to config/local_paths.yaml
#    and set import_weights path. Not needed for core build.
```

### Building

```bash
# Auto-update (default): detect new revisions → download → build → daily → ETR → quality
Rscript src/00_build_timeseries.R

# Full rebuild from scratch
Rscript src/00_build_timeseries.R --full

# Core only: build + unweighted daily series + quality (no import weights needed)
Rscript src/00_build_timeseries.R --full --core-only

# Incremental from a specific revision
Rscript src/00_build_timeseries.R --start-from rev_25

# Build only (skip downstream: daily series, ETR, quality report)
Rscript src/00_build_timeseries.R --build-only

# Standalone downstream scripts (also run automatically by 00_build)
Rscript src/09_daily_series.R
Rscript src/08_weighted_etr.R
Rscript src/quality_report.R
```

The default mode checks for a previous build, identifies new revisions, downloads missing JSON, builds the timeseries incrementally, and runs all downstream scripts. Weighted ETR and TPC comparison require external files configured in `config/local_paths.yaml`; without them, these steps are skipped gracefully.

### Comparison Workflows

Validation is separate from the core build. The currently supported comparison workflows are TPC validation and weighted ETR reporting with optional TPC overlay:

```bash
# Run all available comparisons (TPC validation + weighted ETR overlay)
Rscript src/run_comparisons.R

# TPC point-in-time validation only
Rscript src/run_comparisons.R --tpc

# Weighted ETR with TPC overlay only
Rscript src/run_comparisons.R --etr
```

Comparison outputs go to `output/comparisons/`. These require TPC benchmark data and/or import weights configured in `config/local_paths.yaml`. Cross-repo Tariff-ETRs comparison remains a follow-up task and is not yet fully wired into `run_comparisons.R`.

### Querying and Exporting Daily Data

The canonical dataset is the interval-encoded timeseries (`rate_timeseries.rds`), where rates are piecewise-constant between revision dates. Daily data is derived from this on demand:

```r
source('src/helpers.R')
source('src/09_daily_series.R')

ts <- readRDS('data/timeseries/rate_timeseries.rds')
pp <- load_policy_params()

# Point-in-time query (single date, all products/countries)
snapshot <- get_rates_at_date(ts, '2026-06-15', policy_params = pp)

# Export a filtered daily slice (e.g., China products for June 2026)
export_daily_slice(ts, c('2026-06-01', '2026-06-30'),
                   countries = '5700', policy_params = pp,
                   output_path = 'output/exports/china_june.csv')

# Export by product prefix (all countries, one HS chapter)
export_daily_slice(ts, c('2025-01-01', '2025-12-31'),
                   products = '72', policy_params = pp,
                   output_path = 'output/exports/steel_2025.parquet')
```

**Why on-demand slicing instead of a pre-built daily panel?** A full daily expansion is ~3.5 billion rows (20K products x 240 countries x 730 days). The interval file is the same data at ~0.1% of the size. For most use cases — model inputs, event studies, country/product analysis — `export_daily_slice()` produces the needed subset in seconds. A pre-materialized partitioned Parquet dataset (see `docs/daily_series_recommendations.md`) would serve batch pipelines that need the full panel, but this has not been implemented because no current downstream consumer requires it. If that changes, the interval-to-daily expansion logic is already built and the partitioning strategy is documented.

### Manual Data-Prep Workflow

When USITC publishes new Chapter 99 PDFs, regenerate static resource files before building:

```bash
# 1. Check for new revisions via USITC API
curl -s "https://hts.usitc.gov/reststop/releaseList" | head -c 500

# 2. Download new JSON
Rscript src/02_download_hts.R --dry-run    # Check what's missing
Rscript src/02_download_hts.R              # Download missing files

# 3. Regenerate 301 product lists and floor exemptions from Ch99 PDF
Rscript src/scrape_us_notes.R --all

# 4. Add rows to config/revision_dates.csv for new revisions

# 5. Run full pipeline
Rscript src/00_build_timeseries.R
```

---

## Methodological Details

### Stacking Formulas

Tariff authorities overlap. Section 232 and IEEPA reciprocal are **mutually exclusive** (232 takes precedence). For derivative 232 products (`metal_share < 1.0`), IEEPA reciprocal/fentanyl apply to the non-metal portion of customs value. Implemented in `helpers.R:apply_stacking_rules()` and `06_calculate_rates.R`.

**China with 232 product:**
```
total = rate_232 + rate_ieepa_recip × nonmetal + rate_ieepa_fent + rate_301 + rate_s122 × nonmetal + rate_section_201 + rate_other
```

**China without 232 product:**
```
total = rate_ieepa_recip + rate_ieepa_fent + rate_301 + rate_s122 + rate_section_201 + rate_other
```

**Other countries with 232 product:**
```
total = rate_232 + (rate_ieepa_recip + rate_ieepa_fent + rate_s122) × nonmetal + rate_301 + rate_section_201 + rate_other
```

**Other countries without 232 product:**
```
total = rate_ieepa_recip + rate_ieepa_fent + rate_s122 + rate_301 + rate_section_201 + rate_other
```

Where `nonmetal_share = 1 - metal_share` when `rate_232 > 0` and `metal_share < 1.0`, else `0`. For base 232 products (steel, aluminum, autos, copper), `metal_share = 1.0` so `nonmetal_share = 0`, preserving the mutual exclusion. For derivative products (~130 aluminum-containing articles), `metal_share < 1.0` (default 0.50) so IEEPA/fentanyl apply to the remaining portion.

**USMCA exemption:** Products with "S"/"S+" in `special` field get IEEPA reciprocal and fentanyl zeroed out. Section 232 still applies regardless of USMCA status.

**China fentanyl exclusion:** China/Hong Kong are excluded from blanket fentanyl application because their 9903.90.xx footnote rates already incorporate fentanyl — adding it would double-count ~10pp.

### Section 232 Coverage

| Product Scope | Ch99 Range | Identification | Coverage |
|--------------|-----------|----------------|----------|
| Steel (Ch. 72–73) | 9903.80–82.xx | Blanket chapter match | ~1,800 products |
| Aluminum (Ch. 76) | 9903.85.xx | Blanket chapter match | ~600 products |
| Autos (heading 8703 + light trucks) | 9903.94.xx | Heading-level prefix match (17 prefixes) | USMCA-exempt |
| Copper (ch74 + ch8544) | 9903.78.xx | 80 HTS10 codes from US Note 36(b) via `s232_copper_products.csv` | Not USMCA-exempt |
| Aluminum derivatives (~130 products) | 9903.85.04/.07/.08 | Blanket product match from `s232_derivative_products.csv` | Metal content share applies |

**Metal content for derivatives:** The tariff applies only to the metal content portion of customs value. Configurable share methods: flat (50%), CBO (product-level buckets from `resources/cbo/`), BEA (default, HS10-level shares from BEA Detail I-O table via `resources/metal_content_shares_bea_hs10.csv`). See `config/policy_params.yaml:metal_content`.

**232 country exemptions (pre-March 2025):** Before Proclamation 10896, CA/MX, EU-27, UK, Japan, South Korea, Australia, Brazil, Argentina, and Ukraine had TRQ/quota agreements at 0%. Russia had a permanent 200% override. These are not encoded in the HTS JSON and are configured in `section_232_country_exemptions` in `policy_params.yaml`. Modeled as binary (0% or override), matching Tariff-ETRs methodology.

### Section 301 Product Lists and Aggregation

| Ch99 Range | HTS Note | Linkage | Products |
|-----------|----------|---------|----------|
| 9903.86–88.xx | US Note 20 | Footnotes + blanket list (Lists 1–4B) | ~10,200 via `s301_product_lists.csv` |
| 9903.89.xx | US Note 21 | Description-defined (List 4A exclusions) | Not yet captured |
| 9903.91.xx | US Note 31 | Footnotes + blanket list (Biden acceleration) | ~390 via `s301_product_lists.csv` |
| 9903.92.xx | US Note 31 | Footnotes + blanket list (crane duties) | ~20 via `s301_product_lists.csv` |

**Generation-based rate stacking:** MAX within each generation (original Trump 9903.88.xx / Biden 9903.91–92.xx), SUM across generations. This correctly handles products on both Trump and Biden lists (e.g., Trump List 3 at 25% + Biden at 25% = 50% total).

**Biden-only 301 steel products** (ch72/73/76) are genuinely not on Trump lists; their 301 rate is 25%, not 50%.

### IEEPA Rate Type Classification

When both surcharge and floor entries exist for the same country/phase, floor entries take priority (`type_priority` in summarization):

- **Surcharge** (most countries): flat additional duty (e.g., +20%)
- **Floor** (EU, Japan, S. Korea, Switzerland, Liechtenstein): minimum rate — only adds duty if `base_rate < floor_rate`. Formula: `max(0, floor_rate - base_rate)`
- **Passthrough** (`base_rate >= floor_rate`): no additional duty

### IEEPA Duty-Free Treatment

Configurable via `ieepa_duty_free_treatment` in `policy_params.yaml`. Options: `'all'` (default, apply IEEPA to all products) or `'nonzero_base_only'` (skip products with zero MFN base rate, matching TPC methodology; adds ~8.5pp exact match at rev_32).

### Floor Country Product Exemptions

Per-revision floor exemptions loaded via `load_revision_floor_exemptions()` in `helpers.R`, with fallback for revisions without specific exemption files. Stored in `data/us_notes/floor_exempt_{revision}.csv` (with fallback to `resources/floor_exempt_products.csv`).

### Swiss Framework Override

EO 14346: date-bounded override in `swiss_framework` config. Switzerland and Liechtenstein receive a 15% floor structure. `finalized: false` until confirmed; originally set to expire March 31, 2026.

### Section 122 Expiry Enforcement

The Trade Act §122 limits blanket tariffs to 150 days. Enforcement at three levels:

1. **Build time** (`06_calculate_rates.R`): revisions after expiry date get `rate_s122 = 0`
2. **Daily aggregates** (`09_daily_series.R`): interval splitting at the expiry boundary
3. **Queries** (`get_rates_at_date()` in `helpers.R`): zeroes Section 122 for post-expiry dates

Controlled by `section_122` config in `policy_params.yaml` with `effective`, `expiry`, and `finalized` fields.

### USMCA Eligibility

USMCA eligibility is determined from the HTS `special` field: products with "S" or "S+" in any parenthesized group are flagged as eligible. `extract_usmca_eligibility()` checks all parenthesized groups (fixed: S+ in secondary groups is now detected). ~24% of products are USMCA-eligible.

USMCA-eligible products for Canada/Mexico get IEEPA reciprocal and fentanyl zeroed out. Section 232 still applies. This is a binary classification — no utilization-rate adjustment (see [Current Issues](#current-issues)).

### Fentanyl Carve-Outs

`extract_ieepa_fentanyl_rates()` returns all entries with an `entry_type` column (`'general'`/`'carveout'`). Rates: Mexico +25%, Canada +35% (raised from 25% at ~rev_17). Carve-outs: Canada energy/minerals +10%, Canada/Mexico potash +10%. Product list in `resources/fentanyl_carveout_products.csv` (308 HTS-8 prefixes).

For countries with multiple fentanyl entries, the first entry per country (by Ch99 code order) is the general rate; later entries are exceptions.

### IEEPA Phase/Rate Selection

- **Phase 2 over Phase 1:** When both phases exist for a country, prefer Phase 2 (supersedes with updated rates)
- **Within a phase:** Pick best entry — floor > surcharge > highest rate
- **Across phases:** Phase 2 + country-specific EO rates sum (e.g., India Phase 2 +25% + EO +25% = +50%)

### Hardcoded Elements

| Constant | Location | Value | Used For |
|----------|----------|-------|----------|
| `CTY_CHINA` | `policy_params.yaml` | `'5700'` | Stacking rules, fentanyl exclusion |
| `CTY_CANADA` | `policy_params.yaml` | `'1220'` | USMCA exemption |
| `CTY_MEXICO` | `policy_params.yaml` | `'2010'` | USMCA exemption |
| `CTY_HK` | `policy_params.yaml` | `'5820'` | Fentanyl exclusion |
| `EU27_CODES` | `policy_params.yaml` | 27 Census codes | Expanding "European Union" Ch99 entries |

## Validation

Comparison against TPC benchmark data, matched by revision-to-TPC-date:

| Revision | TPC Date | Within 2pp | Import-Weighted ETR (Tracker) | Import-Weighted ETR (TPC) | Diff (pp) |
|----------|----------|------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------|
| rev_6 | 2025-03-17 | 82.3% | 10.42% | 7.99% | +2.44 |
| rev_10 | 2025-04-17 | 93.1% | 15.20% | 23.48% | -8.28 |
| rev_17 | 2025-07-17 | 90.6% | 16.43% | 15.35% | +1.08 |
| rev_18 | 2025-10-17 | 79.9% | 16.19% | 18.20% | -2.01 |
| rev_32 | 2025-11-17 | 84.9% | 15.93% | 16.14% | -0.21 |

Regenerate with: `Rscript src/test_tpc_comparison.R`

The within-2pp match rate improved significantly after the March 2026 base rate inheritance fix (+9.3pp at rev_18, +11.1pp at rev_32). The rev_10 ETR outlier (-8.28pp) reflects the April 9 reciprocal suspension period — the tracker may understate the brief window when high Liberation Day rates were active. The tracker is within ~1pp of TPC at the latest two dates.

**Key gap sources:** (1) China+232 reciprocal stacking (methodological difference, see below); (2) EU/Japan/Korea floor residual (partially explained by duty-free treatment setting, see below); (3) USMCA binary vs. utilization-adjusted.

## Tariff-ETRs Cross-Validation

Import-weighted effective tariff rates compared against [Tariff-ETRs](https://github.com/Budget-Lab-Yale/Tariff-ETRs) `2-21_temp` scenario at three dates (total imports denominator: $3,124B):

| Date | Tracker | Tariff-ETRs | Diff (pp) | Regime |
|------|---------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| 2026-01-01 | 16.02% | 14.25% | +1.77 | IEEPA + fentanyl + 232 + 301 |
| 2026-02-24 | 12.01% | 10.49% | +1.53 | S122 + 232 + 301 (IEEPA zeroed) |
| 2026-07-24 | 7.62% | 7.29% | +0.33 | 232 + 301 + MFN only |

**Key divergence sources:** (1) USMCA share granularity — tracker uses product-level Census SPI data vs ETRs' GTAP sector-level shares (tracker confirmed correct by TPC); (2) 301 rate treatment (tracker correct — Biden supersedes Trump on 8 overlap products); (3) 232 product coverage gaps (bilateral — ETRs missing ch72 base steel; ch87 autos needs investigation); (4) Copper 232 product coverage (resolved — parsed US Note 36(b), 80/80 match with ETRs). Full details in `docs/comparison_vs_tariff_etrs.md`.

## Current Issues

### Open implementation gaps

**1. Section 301 exclusions (9903.89.xx).** Some 9903.89.xx exclusion entries reference US Note product lists that are not parsed. Excluded products may incorrectly receive the base 301 rate. Low impact (~61 products).

**2. EU floor rate residual (~4pp systematic).** EU/Japan/Korea/Swiss countries show ~35–42% exact match with TPC, with ~4pp mean excess. This residual has two components:

- **Duty-free treatment (configurable, ~38% of gap rows):** The tracker defaults to `ieepa_duty_free_treatment: 'all'` — applying IEEPA reciprocal to all products including those with 0% MFN base rate. TPC excludes duty-free products. Setting `nonzero_base_only` in `policy_params.yaml` eliminates this component and improves match rates materially. The legal text supports either interpretation; the current default follows the stricter reading.
- **Continuous rate residual (~62% of gap rows):** For products where the tracker applies the full 15% floor, TPC assigns rates spanning 1–14% — a continuous distribution suggesting product-level methodology beyond the simple floor formula. This portion remains unexplained.

**3. Ch87 (autos) gap vs Tariff-ETRs (~12pp).** Chapter 87 shows ETRs substantially higher than the tracker. Likely driven by differences in auto parts coverage or USMCA share treatment for CA/MX auto products. Needs a focused reconciliation table broken out by vehicle type, parts, and USMCA partner.

**4. Section 122 expiry uncertainty.** The 150-day statutory limit expires approximately July 23, 2026. Whether Congress extends the authority or the administration shifts to an alternative legal basis is unknown. The `finalized` flag in `policy_params.yaml` controls behavior; the projection horizon extends to 2026-12-31 with S122 zeroed after expiry.

### Methodological differences (not bugs)

**China+232 reciprocal stacking (~920 products, ~25pp gap vs TPC).** For Chinese products subject to Section 232, TPC stacks IEEPA reciprocal on top of 232 (e.g., 232(25%) + recip(25%) + fent(10%) + 301(25%) = 85%). We apply mutual exclusion per Tariff-ETRs methodology: 232 takes precedence over IEEPA reciprocal, so reciprocal contributes 0pp on base 232 products. This is a deliberate methodological choice — our approach follows the legal authority structure (Section 232 and IEEPA are separate authorities with different statutory bases). The `stacking_method = 'tpc_additive'` option in `apply_stacking_rules()` reproduces TPC's additive behavior for diagnostic comparison.

**China IEEPA reciprocal rate (34% vs ~25%).** The statutory IEEPA reciprocal rate for China is 34% (from 9903.01.63). TPC shows ~25%, likely reflecting the May 2025 US-China bilateral agreement. Our system correctly tracks the suspension marker in the HTS JSON; the remaining discrepancy reflects timing differences in how the bilateral agreement is encoded. Not actionable without new evidence of a parser error.

### Resolved

- **Copper 232 product coverage:** Parsed US Note 36(b) via `scrape_us_notes.R --copper`. 80 HTS10 codes match ETRs exactly. Now uses `resources/s232_copper_products.csv`.
- **USMCA utilization rates:** Product-level Census SPI data replaces binary S/S+ eligibility.
- **Base rate inheritance:** Statistical suffixes inherit MFN from parent indent (11,558 products fixed).
- **301 Biden supersession:** Biden rates supersede Trump on 8 overlapping products via `max()` aggregation.
