## Low Priority / Future

### 8. USMCA utilization rate adjustment
USMCA eligibility is binary (from HTS `special` field). Diagnostic confirms TPC uses **product-level utilization rates** — not binary eligibility. For products we mark as USMCA-eligible, TPC's implied utilization rates span 0-100% (median ~55% CA, ~44% MX). This means TPC charges `(1 - utilization_rate) * full_tariff` rather than 0% for USMCA products. The symmetric mismatch (~1,600 CA + 1,270 MX products Type 1; ~1,680 CA + 1,900 MX Type 2) is driven by this methodological difference.

**Data sources for product-level utilization rates:**
1. **USITC DataWeb API** (recommended): Query HTS-10 imports by program (USMCA vs total) for CA/MX. Free API at `datawebws.usitc.gov/dataweb/api/v2/`. Requires Login.gov account. Monthly data, ~2-month lag.
2. **Census SPI Databank**: Bulk monthly fixed-width files at HTS-10 level (`census.gov/foreign-trade/data/SPIM.html`). Country subcode "S"/"S+" = USMCA. Parse with `readr::read_fwf()`. Need separate total import pull for denominator.
3. **CBP FTA Utilization Reports**: Aggregate only (75-88% overall), no product-level breakdown. Useful for validation.

**Implementation approach**: For each HTS-8, compute `utilization_rate = usmca_imports / total_imports` from DataWeb. In `06_calculate_rates.R`, replace binary USMCA exemption with weighted: `effective_rate = full_tariff * (1 - utilization_rate)`. Note: USMCA utilization surged from ~25% to ~88% between late 2024 and late 2025 (importers claiming USMCA to avoid IEEPA), so time-varying rates are ideal.

### ~~9. Clean up legacy v1 pipeline~~ (Done)
See Done section.

### 10. Counterfactual scenario validation
`08_apply_scenarios.R` exists but hasn't been tested against the full timeseries. Verify:

- `apply_scenario(ts, 'baseline')` equals raw rates
- `apply_scenario(ts, 'no_ieepa')` zeros IEEPA columns
- Scenario totals are internally consistent after re-stacking

### 11. Automated HTS revision detection
Currently new revisions are manually downloaded and added to `config/revision_dates.csv`. Consider:

- Scraping `hts.usitc.gov` for new revision notifications
- Auto-downloading JSON when new revisions appear
- Running incremental pipeline on detection

## Done

### ~~Clean up legacy v1 pipeline~~ (Done)
Removed 11 v1 pipeline scripts (`src/v1_*.R`) and 2 v1-only config files (`config/authority_mapping.yaml`, `config/country_rules.yaml`). Verified zero references from v2 pipeline — v1 files only referenced each other. Updated CLAUDE.md and README.md to remove v1 documentation sections.

### ~~Map dates of HTS revision updates~~ (Implemented)
New script `src/13_revision_changelog.R` diffs Ch99 entries across all 35 consecutive revision pairs, detecting additions, removals, rate changes, and suspensions (via description text matching). Outputs `output/changelog/revision_diffs.csv` (467 diff entries) and `output/changelog/revision_summary.csv`. Comprehensive timeline documented in `docs/revision_changelog.md` with key milestones: Liberation Day (rev_7), Phase 1 pause (rev_9), Geneva Agreement (rev_12), 232 doubling (rev_14), Phase 2 (rev_18), floor country frameworks (rev_23/32/2026_basic). Added `policy_event` column to `config/revision_dates.csv` linking each revision to its policy change.

### ~~USMCA classification mismatch~~ (Investigated)
Diagnostic revealed two findings:

1. **S+ parsing bug (165 products)**: `extract_usmca_eligibility()` only matched program codes from the first parenthesized group in the HTS `special` field. Products with `S+` in a secondary group (e.g., `"Free (BH,CL,...) See 9823.xx.xx (S+)"`) were missed. Fixed by using `str_extract_all()` to check all parenthesized groups. USMCA-eligible products: 4,787 → 4,952.

2. **Utilization rate (main cause, ~5,700 products)**: TPC uses product-level USMCA utilization rates, not binary eligibility. For products we mark USMCA-eligible (rate = 0%), TPC charges a fraction of the full tariff: `TPC_rate = (1 - utilization_rate) * full_tariff`. Implied utilization rates span 0-100% (median ~55% CA, ~44% MX). The symmetric mismatch pattern (Type 1: we say 0%, TPC says ~18%; Type 2: we say 35/25%, TPC says 0%) is driven by this methodological difference. Our binary approach is correct per HTS data; improvement requires external USMCA claim rate data. See TODO #8.

CA/MX exact match: 44.3% / 44.5% — primarily limited by the utilization rate issue.

### ~~Switzerland IEEPA over-application (+24pp)~~ (Fixed)
Per [90 FR 59281](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/12/18/2025-23316) (FR Doc. 2025-23316, Dec 18, 2025): EO 14346 implements the US-Switzerland-Liechtenstein trade framework, effective Nov 14, 2025 (retroactive). Terminates 9903.02.36 (Liechtenstein +15% surcharge) and 9903.02.58 (Switzerland +39% surcharge). New entries 9903.02.82-91 establish a 15% floor structure matching EU/Japan/S. Korea pattern: products with base rate >= 15% get no additional duty; products with base rate < 15% are raised to 15%. Also exempts PTAAP agricultural/natural resources, civil aircraft, and non-patented pharmaceuticals.

Fix: Added Switzerland (4419) and Liechtenstein (4411) to `floor_countries` in `config/policy_params.yaml`. Added override logic in `06_calculate_rates.R` that converts surcharge → floor for countries listed in `floor_countries` when the HTS JSON hasn't yet been updated. Created `docs/active_hts_changes.md` to track Federal Register changes not yet reflected in HTS JSON. Conditional expiry: framework must be finalized by March 31, 2026.

### ~~China IEEPA reciprocal rate: 34% vs ~20%~~ (Fixed)
Post-Geneva (rev_17+), 9903.01.63 is marked `[Compiler's note: provision suspended.]` in HTS JSON. Suspension detection in `extract_ieepa_rates()` was not triggering due to encoding/format variation. Added robust secondary regex check (`\\[Compiler.*suspended`). China's Phase 1 rate now correctly caps to the 10% universal baseline. Expected impact: ~17K China products drop from 34% to 10% IEEPA reciprocal.

### ~~Phantom IEEPA countries (~95K false positive pairs)~~ (Fixed)
Countries with legitimate IEEPA entries that TPC doesn't model — Syria (5020), Moldova (4641), Laos (5530), Falkland Islands (3720), DR Congo (7660) — were inflating validation discrepancies. Added `tpc_excluded_countries` list to `config/policy_params.yaml` and exclusion filters in `test_tpc_comparison.R` and `07_validate_tpc.R`. Actual calculated rates unchanged; only validation comparisons affected.

### ~~Section 232 derivative products~~ (Implemented)
~130 aluminum-containing articles outside chapter 76 now covered via blanket matching using `resources/s232_derivative_products.csv`. Metal content scaling configurable (flat 50% default, CBO product-level buckets). Stacking rules updated for non-metal portion.

### ~~Floor country IEEPA rate selection (Japan/S. Korea)~~ (Fixed)
When both surcharge and floor entries existed for the same country/phase, tie-breaking now correctly prefers floor entries. Products with base_rate > 15% correctly get `rate_ieepa_recip = 0`.

### ~~India & Brazil rate discrepancy~~ (Fixed)
Both countries had country-specific Executive Order entries in 9903.01.76-89 (outside extraction range 43-75) that stack with Phase 2 rates. Brazil: EO 14323 at +40% (9903.01.77) + Phase 2 +10% (9903.02.09) = 50%. India: +25% (9903.01.84) + Phase 2 +25% (9903.02.26) = 50%. Expanded extraction range to 43-89, added `country_eo` phase label, updated rate selection to sum across phases but pick best within phase. India: 84.4% exact match. Brazil: 73.6%.

### ~~Universal IEEPA baseline for unlisted countries~~ (Fixed)
~143 countries with no individual IEEPA entries were getting 0% reciprocal instead of the 10% universal baseline (9903.01.25). Now apply universal baseline as default for all countries not in any IEEPA entry, excluding CA/MX (fentanyl-only regime). Fixed Tunisia from 0.2% to 91.6% exact match (within-phase dedup: take best entry per phase, not sum). Overall rev_32 exact match: 52% → 60.3%.

### ~~Section 301 blanket coverage~~ (Implemented)
~10,400 HTS8 product codes now applied as blanket tariff for China, closing most of the 301 product gap.

### ~~232+fentanyl stacking for CA/MX~~ (Fixed)
Fentanyl was being multiplied by `nonmetal_share` (which is 0 for base 232 products), effectively zeroing it out. Fentanyl is a separate IEEPA authority that applies to full customs value regardless of 232 status. Changed `apply_stacking_rules()` in `helpers.R` to add `rate_ieepa_fent` directly instead of scaling by `nonmetal_share`. Mexico 232 exact match: ~5% → 80.2%. Canada 232: 0.2% (remaining gap is CA fentanyl 35% vs TPC 25%, see analysis below).

**CA 232 fentanyl rate discrepancy (not a bug)**: Our CA fentanyl = 35% (from 9903.01.10 in HTS JSON), producing 60% for 232 products (25%+35%). TPC shows 50% (25%+25%). TPC updated non-232 CA products from 25% to 35% (between July and October 2025 dates) but appears not to have updated 232 products. Our rate is correct per the HTS source data.

### ~~CA/MX fentanyl product-level carve-outs~~ (Implemented)
Product-specific fentanyl carve-outs for CA (energy/minerals +10%, potash +10%) and MX (potash +10%). `extract_ieepa_fentanyl_rates()` now returns all entries with `entry_type` column ('general' vs 'carveout'). Product lists in `resources/fentanyl_carveout_products.csv` (308 HTS8 prefixes sourced from Tariff-ETRs config). Step 3 in `calculate_rates_for_revision()` applies carve-out rates to matching products, falling back to the general blanket rate. Expected impact: ~915 CA and ~850 MX products drop from 35%/25% to 10%.

### ~~2026 HTS revision naming convention~~ (Implemented)
Added `parse_revision_id()` helper in `helpers.R` that extracts year + revision type from any revision ID (e.g., `'2026_rev_3'` -> `year=2026, rev='rev_3'`; `'rev_32'` -> `year=2025, rev='rev_32'`). Replaced hardcoded 2025/2026 year checks in `resolve_json_path()`, `build_download_url()`, `download_missing_revisions()`, `build_full_timeseries()`, `run_update()`, and `01_scrape_revision_dates.R` cross-reference. All year scanning is now dynamic — derived from `revision_dates.csv` entries. Supports `2026_rev_1`, `2027_basic`, etc. without code changes.

### ~~EU floor rate residual~~ (Partially fixed — floor country product exemptions implemented)
Diagnostic on rev_32 for 27 EU floor countries + Japan + S. Korea. Floor formula `max(0, 15% - base_rate)` is correctly implemented (all 8,831 Germany floor-active products match expected). Three distinct error patterns identified:

1. **EU-specific product exemptions (~1,600 products/country, ~16% of TPC-matched products)**:
   Ch99 entries 9903.02.74/75/77 define product categories exempt from the EU floor (agricultural/natural resources, civil aircraft, non-patented pharmaceuticals). These are blanket exemptions — NOT referenced via product footnotes. Product lists are defined in US Notes to Chapter 99, not parseable from HTS JSON API. We incorrectly apply the 15% floor to these products. Consistent across EU countries (82-86% overlap DE-FR-IT). Chapter distribution: ch98 (special provisions, 100% TPC=0), ch61/62 (apparel, ~50-60% TPC=0), ch30 (pharma, ~88% TPC=0). These exempt products are entirely distinct from the ~1,087 general IEEPA Annex A exempt products (zero overlap).

2. **Continuous rate distribution (~2,700 base=0 products with TPC rates between 1-14%)**:
   For products where we apply the full 15% floor, TPC assigns rates spanning 1-14% — a continuous distribution, not binary (0% or 15%). This mirrors the USMCA utilization rate pattern and suggests TPC uses trade-weighted or other product-level methodology beyond a simple floor formula. Contributes ~3-4pp of average excess.

3. **232 products under-counted (-12pp mean diff, 1,172 products)**:
   EU 232 products have only 3.2% exact match with -12pp mean diff. Separate issue from the floor — likely related to EU-specific 232 exemption/exclusion patterns.

**Net result**: Germany 41.5% exact match, mean diff +1.55pp. Floor countries range 32-44% exact match.

**Update**: Pattern A (product exemptions) now addressed. Extended `12_scrape_us_notes.R` to parse floor country product exemptions from US Note 2 subdivisions (v)(xx)-(xxiv) and Note 3. Product lists for PTAAP (agricultural/natural resources), civil aircraft, non-patented pharmaceuticals, and particular articles extracted from Chapter 99 PDF for EU, S. Korea, Switzerland/Liechtenstein, and Japan. Output in `resources/floor_exempt_products.csv`. Applied in `06_calculate_rates.R` — exempt products get `rate_ieepa_recip = 0` instead of the 15% floor. Patterns B (continuous rates) and C (232 interaction) remain open.

### ~~US Note 20/31 product lists~~ (Implemented)
New script `src/12_scrape_us_notes.R` downloads Chapter 99 PDF from USITC, finds "Heading 9903.XX.XX applies to" anchors, extracts HTS subheading codes from each product list section. Covers Note 20 (Lists 1-3 + 4A: 9903.88.01/.02/.03/.15) and Note 31 (Biden acceleration: 9903.91.01-.11). Note 21 doesn't exist as a separate note — List 4A modifications are embedded in Note 20 subdivision (u). Parser found 10,587 codes with 10,132 matching existing CSV (strong validation), adding 296 new entries (mostly List 3). Run with `Rscript src/12_scrape_us_notes.R` (or `--dry-run` to preview). Requires `pdftools` package.
