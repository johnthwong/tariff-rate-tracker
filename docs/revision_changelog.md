## Notes

1. **Phase 1 suspension (rev_9-17)**: All country-specific Phase 1 entries (9903.01.43-76) were suspended during the 90-day pause. The universal 10% baseline (9903.01.25) remained active throughout.

2. **China IEEPA trajectory**: +10% (rev_1) → +34% (rev_7) → +84% (rev_8) → +125% (rev_9) → +34% (rev_12, Geneva) → suspended/10% baseline (rev_12+). China's Phase 2 rate is via 9903.01.77 at +40% (EO 14323 / Brazil EO section).

3. **Floor country pattern**: EU (rev_18/24), Japan (rev_23), S. Korea (rev_32), Switzerland/Liechtenstein (2026_basic). Each gets passthrough (base >= 15%) + floor (base < 15% → 15%) + exemption entries.

4. **"Other" authority**: The `classify_authority()` function classifies IEEPA Phase 1 (9903.01.xx) and Phase 2 (9903.02.xx) entries as "other" rather than "ieepa_reciprocal". The IEEPA reciprocal count reflects only 9903.90/93/95/96 entries, not the full IEEPA range. The extraction pipeline (`05_parse_policy_params.R`) correctly handles the full ranges.

5. **TPC date gaps**: rev_18 (effective 2025-08-07) is validated against TPC date 2025-10-17 — a 2+ month gap. Policy changes between these dates (revisions 19-27) may cause discrepancies. See `config/revision_dates.csv` for the full date mapping.
