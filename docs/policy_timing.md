# Policy Timing: Announcement vs. HTS Effective Dates

The tracker does **not** simply use raw USITC HTS release dates for every revision. The default build uses a hybrid timing rule:

- for most revisions, it follows the tracker’s curated `effective_date` chronology in [config/revision_dates.csv](/C:/Users/ji252/Documents/GitHub/tariff-rate-tracker/config/revision_dates.csv), which is designed to reflect the tariff-policy sequence rather than the literal archive publication calendar;
- for the two revisions where the HTS lagged the policy materially and shifting them does not create timeline collisions (`rev_16` and `2026_rev_4`), the default build uses `policy_effective_date`;
- users who want raw HTS timing can opt out with `--use-hts-dates`.

This document explains where legal effective dates, HTS archive dates, and the tracker’s chosen modeling dates differ.

## How to use this document

The checked-in [config/revision_dates.csv](/C:/Users/ji252/Documents/GitHub/tariff-rate-tracker/config/revision_dates.csv) is the tracker’s timing control table. In the default build:

- `effective_date` is the main tracker chronology;
- `policy_effective_date` is used only for the small set of HTS-late revisions where the repo intentionally overrides the main date;
- raw HTS archive timing is available by running the pipeline with `--use-hts-dates`.

So this file should be read as a modeling schedule, not as a verbatim copy of the USITC archive calendar.

## Summary of material timing gaps

Three categories of discrepancy:

### 1. HTS published before legal effective date (tracker overstates)
- **232 Autos** (Proclamation 10908): HTS Mar 12 vs. effective Apr 3 (22 days early)
- **232 Copper**: HTS Jul 1 vs. effective Aug 1 (31 days early)
- **MHD 232** (Proclamation 10984): HTS Oct 6 vs. effective Nov 1 (26 days early)

These cause the tracker to apply tariffs before they legally took effect. The ETR impact is modest (232 autos ~0.5pp, copper ~0.2pp, MHD ~0.1pp) because these products are a small share of total imports.

### 2. HTS published after legal effective date (tracker understates)
- **232 steel/aluminum 50%** (Proclamation 10947): Effective Jun 4 vs. HTS Jun 6 (2 days late)
- **SCOTUS ruling** (*Learning Resources v. Trump*): Ruling Feb 20 vs. HTS Feb 24 (4 days late)

The SCOTUS gap is the most material: the tracker shows ~15% ETR for Feb 20-23 when the legal rate was ~11% (IEEPA already void).

### 3. Announcement-to-enactment gaps (tracker correct, but different from SOT reports)
- **Liberation Day** (EO 14257): Announced Apr 2, most rates effective Apr 5-9
- **Phase 2** (EO 14326): Signed Jul 31, effective Aug 7
- **EU deal**: Announced Jul 27, enacted Aug 7

These are not tracker errors — the tracker correctly follows legal effective dates. But comparison publications (e.g., Budget Lab State of Tariffs) often model announced policy immediately, creating apparent gaps.

## Infrastructure for date adjustment

The `config/revision_dates.csv` includes a `policy_effective_date` column alongside the existing `effective_date` (HTS publication date). This column is populated for the 7 revisions where the legal effective date differs from the HTS date.

### Default: policy dates (where HTS was late)

The pipeline defaults to using legal policy effective dates for revisions where the HTS was published **after** the legal effective date. Only two revisions qualify:

- **rev_16** (232 steel/aluminum 50%): HTS Jun 6 → policy Jun 4 (2 days late)
- **2026_rev_4** (SCOTUS + S122): HTS Feb 24 → policy Feb 20 (4 days late)

Revisions where HTS was published **before** the legal effective date (rev_6, rev_7, rev_11, rev_26) are NOT overridden, because shifting them later creates timeline collisions and reorderings (e.g., Liberation Day appearing after China's retaliatory escalation). For these cases, the tracker follows the HTS publication date — the date when the rates were legally in the tariff schedule — even if CBP collection began later.

For the SCOTUS ruling (2026_rev_4), both IEEPA removal and Section 122 imposition are assigned to the ruling date (Feb 20, 2026), since the S122 EO was signed the same day even though CBP implementation was Feb 24. The `ieepa_invalidation_date` and `section_122.effective_date` in `policy_params.yaml` are also coordinated to Feb 20.

To use raw HTS dates for all revisions instead:

```bash
Rscript src/00_build_timeseries.R --full --use-hts-dates
```

**Bundling analysis:** We decomposed each timing-gap revision to determine what share of its ETR impact belongs to the policy-date component vs. the HTS-date component (import-weighted):

| Revision | Total ETR Change | Policy-date share | HTS-date share | Assessment |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| rev_6 (232 Autos) | +2.25pp | 100% (232) | 0% | Clean — all early by 22 days |
| rev_7 (Liberation Day) | +5.29pp | 100% (IEEPA) | 0% | Clean — all early by 3 days |
| rev_11 (Auto parts) | +1.65pp | 100% (232) | 0% | Clean — all early by 22 days |
| rev_16 (232 50%) | -0.06pp | 100% (232) | 0% | Clean — all late by 2 days (small impact) |
| rev_17 (CA fent + copper) | +0.41pp | 0% | 100% (fentanyl) | **No gap:** copper 232 shows zero ETR impact; fentanyl is correctly dated at Jul 1. `policy_effective_date` left blank. |
| rev_26 (MHD + copper + auto) | +0.00pp | — | — | **No gap:** zero net ETR change despite new ch99 entries. `policy_effective_date` has no effect. |
| 2026_rev_4 (SCOTUS + S122) | -4.18pp | 67.7% (IEEPA+fent removal, Feb 20) | 32.3% (S122 addition, Feb 24) | **Bundled:** flag shifts dominant component correctly but applies S122 4 days early |

For finer-grained control, copy `config/revision_dates.csv` and edit individual `effective_date` values directly.
