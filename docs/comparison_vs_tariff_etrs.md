## Current Validation Status (Post-Fix)

### TPC Product-Level Match Rates

| Revision | TPC Date | Comparisons | Exact (<0.5pp) | Within 2pp | Mean Abs Diff |
|----------|----------|-------------|----------------|------------|---------------|
| rev_6 | 2025-03-17 | 72,563 | 47.4% | 48.2% | 7.97pp |
| rev_10 | 2025-04-17 | 271,037 | 84.4% | **84.8%** | 2.94pp |
| rev_17 | 2025-07-17 | 270,099 | 81.8% | **85.4%** | 2.11pp |
| rev_18 | 2025-10-17 | 269,268 | 65.1% | **67.8%** | 4.59pp |
| rev_32 | 2025-11-17 | 269,249 | 72.8% | **75.7%** | 3.22pp |

Rev_6 is pre-IEEPA (differences dominated by 232 auto/USMCA treatment). Rev_10/17 are peak accuracy. Rev_18/32 are lower due to floor country rate distribution divergence and Phase 2 complexity.

**Duty-free sensitivity**: Switching `ieepa_duty_free_treatment` to `'nonzero_base_only'` would boost rev_32 exact match from 72.8% → 87.9% (+15.1pp). This is the single largest remaining lever — 40,558 products (15.1%) where we apply IEEPA to duty-free products but TPC does not (concentrated in apparel ch61-62, machinery ch84-85).

### Changes Since Initial Comparison (March 2-9, 2026)

| Fix | Impact | New TPC Match |
|-----|--------|---------------|
| T1: USMCA shares applied to 232 auto/MHD | Share-based instead of binary exemption for CA/MX | Resolves Mexico 232 gap |
| T2: 232 auto deal rates (UK/JP/EU/KR) | 12 deal entries now extracted and applied | -1-2pp Japan/EU/UK |
| T3: IEEPA exempt products expanded | 1,087 → 2,172 → 4,325 HTS10 codes (HTS8→10 expansion, Ch98, ITA prefixes) | +2.4pp rev_10, +2.5pp rev_17, +1.9pp rev_18, +3.6pp rev_32 |
| T4: Brazil/India country EO (confirmed correct) | No change — stacking already correct | N/A |
| T7: S122 exempt products (confirmed identical) | No change — both repos have 1,656 codes | N/A |

## Changes Completed and Remaining

### Tracker changes

| # | Change | Status | Files |
|---|--------|--------|-------|
| ~~T1~~ | **Apply product-level USMCA shares to 232 auto/MHD** — replaced binary exemption with `rate_232 * (1 - usmca_share)` using Census SPI shares | **DONE** | `06_calculate_rates.R` step 4 + step 7 |
| ~~T2~~ | **Implement 232 auto deal rates** — fixed ch99 parser, program classification, vehicle/parts separation. Extracts 12 entries: UK surcharge/floor, JP/EU/KR 15% floor | **DONE** | `03_parse_chapter99.R`, `05_parse_policy_params.R`, `06_calculate_rates.R` |
| ~~T3~~ | **Expand IEEPA product exemptions** — (a) merged ETRs exempt products (1,087 → 2,172), (b) expanded HTS8→HTS10 (+1,993), (c) added Ch98 statutory exemption per US Notes (v)(i) (+101), (d) expanded ITA prefixes (+59). Total: 4,325 HTS10 codes | **DONE** | `resources/ieepa_exempt_products.csv`, `src/expand_ieepa_exempt.R` |
| ~~T4~~ | **Brazil/India country EO stacking** — confirmed already correct (country_eo + Phase 2 = 50%) | **RESOLVED** | N/A |
| ~~T6a~~ | **Replace auto parts list with CBP official source** — CBP "Automobile Parts HTS List" (US Note 33(g)/(h), 9903.94.05/.06). Removed 7 MHD-only codes, added 8483.10.30. 136 → 130 prefixes | **DONE** | `resources/s232_auto_parts.txt` |
| ~~T6b~~ | **Verify MHD parts list** — confirmed 182 codes match live HTSUS US Note 34, subdivision (i), heading 9903.74.08 exactly | **RESOLVED** | `resources/s232_mhd_parts.txt` |
| ~~T7~~ | **S122 exempt products** — confirmed identical (1,656 HTS8 codes) | **RESOLVED** | N/A |

### Tariff-ETRs changes

| # | Change | Status | Est. Impact |
|---|--------|--------|-------------|
| E1 | **Replace GTAP-level USMCA shares with product-level Census SPI data** — ETRs' 47-row GTAP file (~85-90% shares) systematically over-exempts; TPC validates tracker's approach (45-51% shares) | **Open** | +4-8pp Canada, +2-3pp Mexico |
| E2 | **Implement 301 generation-based stacking** — assign SUM across Trump/Biden generations instead of flat rate. TPC validates: 85-95% rates only possible with stacking | **Open** | +2-3pp China |

### Joint verification

| # | Item |
|---|------|
| J1 | **301 legal interpretation**: Do Biden 301 modifications *replace* or *supplement* Trump original rates on overlapping products? |
| ~~J2~~ | **232 auto parts product lists**: Resolved — CBP published "Automobile Parts HTS List" (Attachment 2) referencing US Note 33(g)/(h), heading 9903.94.05/.06. 130 HTS codes. Updated `s232_auto_parts.txt`: removed 7 MHD-only codes (8708.99.xx), added 1 missing prefix (8483.10.30). MHD parts list (s232_mhd_parts.txt) unchanged — no equivalent CBP source yet. |

## Overall ETR Comparison (Census import-weighted, including MFN)

| Date | Tracker | Tariff-ETRs | Diff (pp) |
|------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| 2026-01-01 (pre-S122) | 21.02% | 15.59% | **+5.42** |
| 2026-02-24 (pre-S122) | 20.38% | 11.43% | **+8.95** |
| 2026-07-24 (S122 active) | 10.59% | 7.34% | **+3.26** |

Note: ETRs scenario `2-21_temp` uses `2026-02-24` and `2026-07-24` dates (not `2026-02-25`); tracker maps to active revisions `2026_rev_3` and `2026_rev_4` respectively.

## TPC Product-Level Validation

TPC benchmark data (`data/tpc/tariff_by_flow_day.csv`) provides product-level rates at 5 pre-S122 dates for ~240 countries x ~19,800 products.

### USMCA: TPC Confirms Continuous Product-Level Shares

TPC uses continuous product-level USMCA utilization shares, producing a smooth distribution of rates between 0% and the headline rate.

| Country | TPC Implied | Tracker Census SPI | ETRs GTAP Sectors |
|---------|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Canada | **45.5%** | 41.2% | ~85-90% |
| Mexico | **50.7%** | 47.3% | ~75-85% |

**Verdict:** The tracker's Census SPI shares closely match TPC. ETRs GTAP shares are roughly double what TPC uses, confirming ETRs systematically over-exempts CA/MX (proposed change E1).

### Floor Rates: TPC Confirms Floor + Product Exemptions

| Country | 0% (exempt) | ~10% (baseline) | ~15% (floor) | ~25% (reciprocal) |
|---------|------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Japan | 22% | 27% | 30% | 9% |
| S. Korea | 20% | 11% | 53% | — |
| EU avg | 23% | — | 25% | — |

TPC exempts ~22% of Japan products (rate=0%) vs tracker's ~1-2%. This product exemption gap — not missing floor logic — is the main Japan/EU discrepancy driver. The T3 fix (expanding IEEPA exempt products to 2,172) partially addresses this.

### Section 301: TPC Confirms Generation Stacking

| TPC Rate | Count | Likely Decomposition |
|----------|-------|---------------------|
| ~35% | 9,290 (64%) | fentanyl(10%) + 301_Trump(25%) |
| ~60% | 3,982 (28%) | 232(25%) + fentanyl(10%) + 301(25%) |
| ~85% | 421 (3%) | fentanyl(10%) + 301_Trump(25%) + 301_Biden(50%) |
| ~95% | 528 (4%) | recip(10%) + fentanyl(10%) + 301_Trump(25%) + 301_Biden(50%) |

The 85%+ rates are only possible with generation stacking. Validates tracker approach (E2 for ETRs).

---

## Remaining Discrepancy Sources

### 1. Floor Country Product Exemptions (largest remaining gap)

~48,000 EU mismatches (~47% of all). For duty-free products, TPC gives a continuous distribution of rates (0-14.9%) rather than the binary 0% or 15% our floor applies. This suggests TPC uses trade-weighted or partial-credit methodology, or has a much larger exempt product list. The T3 fix (expanding IEEPA exempt products to 4,325 HTS10 — including HTS8→HTS10 expansion, Ch98 statutory exemption, and ITA prefix expansion) narrowed this gap but didn't resolve the continuous-rate pattern. Note: ~513 products where TPC shows 0% have no identified legal basis for exemption — likely a TPC analytical choice to exclude duty-free products from floor application.

### 2. 232 + IEEPA Stacking (methodological difference)

~25,800 products across all groups. TPC stacks IEEPA reciprocal on top of 232 (no mutual exclusion). Our approach follows the Tariff-ETRs legal authority structure. **Documented analytical choice, not a bug.** Accounts for ~25% of all mismatches.

### ~~3. 232 Auto/MHD Parts Prefix Matching (T6a/T6b resolved)~~

Both lists verified against live HTSUS US Notes (Chapter 99, 2026_rev_4 PDF). Auto parts (130 codes) match Note 33 subdivision (g) exactly; MHD parts (182 codes) match Note 34 subdivision (i) exactly. Note: '8471' confirmed as official auto parts prefix. The 7 codes removed from auto parts (8708.99.03/.06/.23/.27/.31/.41, 8708.99.4850) correctly appear only in the MHD list.

### 4. Gulf State / Middle East IEEPA Rates (minor)

Several Middle East countries show TPC systematically 2-3pp higher (Oman, Qatar, UAE). Small overall impact (~0.5pp).

### 5. China Non-301 Product Coverage (negligible)

~170 China products where TPC shows ~20% but we show ~10-17%. Likely 10-digit specificity not captured by 8-digit matching.
